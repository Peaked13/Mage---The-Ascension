Character Description and Background:
	-Appearance:
		-
	-Reference about the rhyme: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Be_Nimble
		-"Jumping candlesticks was a form of fortune telling"!
	-So, a dervish and fire-dancing influenced Ecstatic.
		-Very Physical, as a result.
		-Your dot of Esoterica is about these sorts of practices, especially folk magic fortune
		 telling involving flame (suggestive of possible future specialties in this or Occult. . .).
