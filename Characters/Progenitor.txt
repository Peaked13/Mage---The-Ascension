				-More specialtes? How _does_ Well-Skilled Craftsman work anyways?

		-1 gets empowerment of mental traits, sensing mood shifts / lies (in a way that would fit
		 some kind of paradigm-compatible sensory enhancement, especially smell), and shielding.
		-Further ranks get your useful but weirder feats. Most can still probably fit your paradigm
		 as something involving sending/receiving pheramones or psychoactive chemicals.
	Prime: ?
		-3 would get enchanting life to deal/soak agg and temporary wonders.
		-Less doesn't do much for your plans, save maybe creating life from nothing.

	Phylactery (7 pt. Supernatural Flaw, BoS pg. 94): ?
		-You have a baseball-sized "tumor" on your neck and shoulder, very visible, and thus the
		 reason for your low appearance.
			-In reality, it's an experiment by your Mentor. He identified you before you Awakened
			 as a possible student. . . and thus the subject he needed. What he did to you is the
			 very source of your Genius, and your most important tool.
			-Beneath the surface, it has tendrils spreading into different parts of your body,
			 especially your brain.
			-You use syringes to both extract things from it and inject things into it. It exudes
			 stuff, adds things to your blood stream, develops strange sensory tissue, etc.
			-Made from your own stem cells, from umbilical cord wisely saved by your parents, but
			 now impossible to replace, all available having been used.
