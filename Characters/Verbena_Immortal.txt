Merits & Flaws: (-5 Freebie Points)
	"Immortal" (7 pt. Supernatural Merit, BoS pg. 76):
		-You age 10% as fast as a normal human and will heal (at your usual rate) from any injury
		 that doesn't completely destroy your body so long as your phylactery survives.
	Phylactery (7 pt. Supernatural Flaw, BoS pg. 94):
		- 
		- TODO: Seed? Cat Familiar? Grove, with the unfortunate implications of a place?
		- TODO: Who did this? Your not a powerful enough Mage to have done so. . .
	Spark of Life (5 pt. Supernatural Merit, BoS pg. 78):
		-You heal lethal as if it was bashing, aggravated as if it's one level less than it is, and
		 any amount of bashing within an hour.
		-Healing others with or without magick is -2 difficulty and they share your enhanced natural
		 healing rate as long as they're in physical contact with you. Your touch also sooths minor
		 pains, headaches, muscle spasms, and the like, within a minute or two.
		-Your aura shines brightly, your Resonanace reflects your strong connection to primal life-
		 force. . . and vampires find your blood delicious and twice as nourishing.
