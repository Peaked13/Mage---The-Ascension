Focus:
	-A paradigm: Reality is a series of nested information systems. As above, so below. As in the
	 Digital Web, so in whatever meatspace runs on.
	TODO: define seven instruments
	-HUD glasses with integrated sensors. Google Glass-esque.
	-Controller Glove. Think the NES Power Glove.
	-Cellphone, usually plugged into the rest of the wearable rig.
	

Merits & Flaws:
	Addiction to Caffeine (1 pt. Physical Flaw):
		-Mage doesn't define exact rule impacts, but I think some other WoD systems do.
	Echos (1 pt. Supernatural Flaw):
		-Increased odds of extreme or chaotic outcomes in your presence, inverting the normal curve
		 of probability.
		 -A result, perhaps, of your own actions, as you seize opportunities that probability offers
		  you, causing improbable ripples to spread in your wake.
