Backgrounds: (7 + 5 for Freebie Points spent)
	Avatar: 3
		-Descriptive stuff? Is it a "ghost in the machine"? A chorus of voices online, driving you
		 forward on your crusade? Is it _playing_ you, like a video game character?
	Chantry: 1 (2 points spent on this double cost background)
		-You're a member of The Digital Devils, and have access to their clubhouse on the Web.
		-These two points apparently represent one dot in Chantry: https://discord.com/channels/1029445785118576672/1029445785563172895/1031043670444621834
		-See Roll20 handout for more details.
	Contacts: 2
		-Folks you leak corpo data to, and can get the occasional info from in return.
		-Journalist:
			-Girl reporter trope?
				-When you met, you thought she was into you, the way she listened to your boasting,
				 but she turned out to be into your _info_, and you've had a productive professional
				 relationship ever since.
				-Might up the pathos a bit if your driving goal puts her in danger.
		-Criminal:
			-Interested in your leaked info for different reasons than a journalist.
			-Can also help you score stims, a trait you treasure.
	Hypercram: 5
		-Flavored as a speed-fueled dive into the web?

Spheres: (6 + 1 for Freebie Points spent, with one designated your Affinity, none higher than Arete or perm. Willpower)
	Correspondance (Affinity): 2
		-Data instead? Core pg. 467 suggests it gets an innate -1 difficulty in the Digital Web,
		 which might cancel out any downsides. Flavor is certainly good.
		-I'm having trouble puzzling out the differences and likely need to ask Lesley.
			-This suggests range differences are the biggest difference, and the ranges table in
			 Core seems to back that up: https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Data
				-No ranges at all, in fact, with the table focusing only on the connection aspect.
				-It also doesn't talk about successes, only ranks in the sphere. . .
			-Core's table also suggests Data can take longer?
			-Both spots imply no tech at both ends rules it out entirely, which is certainly a
			 downside, but is also very much your paradigm anyways.
				-Forces, electromagnetic radiation, and creativity might work around that even, a bit.
	Entropy: 2

Arete: 3 (1 + 2 for Freebie Points spent)
Willpower: 7 (5 + 2 for Freebie Points spent)
Quintessence: 3 (Avatar rating)
Paradox: 0 (0)

Focus:
	-A paradigm: Reality is a series of nested information systems. As above, so below. As in the
	 Digital Web, so in whatever meatspace runs on. (What M20 Core apparently labels "Everything is
	 Data".)
	-A practice: Hypertech
	-Instruments:
		-Computers (of course!)
			-Including a wearable rig comprised of a Google Glass-esque HUD with integrated sensors
			 and several control peripherals that you wear when out and about. 
		-A heavily customized cellphone, usually connected to the rest of the wearable rig or
		 whatever other computer you're using.
			-This is your personal instrument for your Correspondence affinity.
			-For a lot of your childhood, this phone (or at least what it descended from, several
			 iterations of customization earlier) _was_ your connection to a wider, digital world.
		-Your heavily customized suite of software packages.
		-A database of techniques and exploits. You've got a copy stored locally on your phone, and
		 backups in various spots around the web.
		-EEG sensor net and hardware, connecting to either the wearable rig or other computers.
			-Pulling your shaggy hair through the sensor net mostly conceals it.
			-A kind of read-only Brain/Computer Interface, but the rig reacting as fast as you think
			 still goes a long ways.
		-Controller Glove. Think the NES Power Glove.
		-Sensor and optics packages.
			-You keep a selection of these customized devices on hand, most meant for "dropping"
			 various places, including several kept on your person when out and one version
			 connected to your pistol.
	-Sphere-specific instruments:
		-Small-E entropy sources, for Entropy. You keep several of these connected to your various
		 devices, mostly based around radio-isotope decay, using them of course for random numbers
		 for cryptograpy. You also, however, use them for less mundane reasons, like determining
		 the random seed for the sector of reality you're currently in, or as feedback when
		 attempting to _influence_ that seed or it's application.
	-Possible future instruments:
		-Drugs once you pick up dots in Mind, or in Life? Your speed, nootropics, and general
		 better-living-through-chemistry would very much fit the character, and those spheres.

Merits & Flaws: (+7 Freebie Points)
	Addiction (3 pt. Physical Flaw, Core pg. 646):
		-You're addicted to stimulants.
		-First exposure was sampling some your father had, during a bout of employment, since that
		 tended to come with absurd hours, scheduling, or both.
	Computer Aptitude (1 pt. Mental Merit, BoS pg. 43): 
		-Minus 2 difficulty to "computer-based rolls", with some caveats about _limited_
		 applicability to magick that you didn't entirely follow.
	Driving Goal (3 pt. Mental Flaw, BoS pg. 51):
		-Taking down the corps would fit this exactly.
	Enemy (1 pt. Social Flaw, Core pg. 647):
		-You have an internet-troll-y rival. Quick to respond to your every post, nothing you do is
		 ever good or pure enough in their eyes, and they're quick to highlight your every mistake.
		-Compounding matters, your avatar presents itself to you in more or less the same way,
		 through internet-based messages, posts, etc. 
		-TODO: Flesh this enemy out a bit further, unless Lesley wants you to leave that to him.
			-Hmm. . . this is also a lot like how you might interact with your avatar. Is there some
			 relation there? Some disident sub-faction of your past lives (or little brother who
			 occasionally grabs the game controls)?
	Overconfident (1 pt. Mental Flaw, BoS pg. 48):
		-I mean, you pretty much have to be, to take on the corps.

Freebie points: 22 (15 + 7 for Merits & Flaws)

Character Description and Background:
	-Appearance:
		-Character art is the SJ Games's Hacker box art.
		-Icon?
			-Possibly an angel? You have notes on this in campaign_notes.txt/
	-Impoverished slum childhood, the child of formerly middle class parents devastated by the
	 automation-driven labor shocks.
		-You blame the corps.
		-Dead mother.
			-You also blame corps.
			-Perhaps of cholera? It's vaguely old-time-y, but also a disease of the exact kind of
			 slums you grew up in. It's pretty reasonable to blame the forces that pushed your
			 family into that kind of poverty.
		-Father slid into the Red Network blackhole, even works off and on as a paid troll for a
		 subsidiary.
			-Yep, you blame corps. NikNak in this case.
		-"Gibson said the future is already here, and that it's just not evenly distributed yet.
		  That's obviously true (_looks around_), but it's more than that. My parents _fell out_
		  of the future. . ."
	-Smashing the corps is your reason to be.
		-It would be hard to believe it's possible, had you not learned anything is possible through
		 the Web at the same time this goal was forming.
	-Your Awakening?
		-
	-Dependent on gang Resources.
	-Living situation?
		-Basement of illegal conversion, with roommates above?
			-Hacker/party vibe, maybe with weird livestreamed angle?
			-_Definitely_ good locks on your door, with an improvised bar to resist forcing.

	-Glock 31 (Roll20, Heavy Pistol, Dmg: 5, Rng. 30, Rate: 3, Cap: 15, Conceal J)
		-Scuffed and duct-taped.
	-Bulky leather jacket, concealing both most of your wearable rig and your gun.
	-Some mix of various stimulants, some legal and some not.

	-Tentative schedule:
		6	Computer 4?

	-Abilities?
		-You have tons with one dot in them, and it's 2 XP to get to 2.
