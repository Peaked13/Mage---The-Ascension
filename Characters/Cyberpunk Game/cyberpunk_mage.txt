Arete: 3 (1 + 2 for Freebie Points spent)
Willpower: 5 (5)
Quintessence: 3 (Avatar rating)
Paradox: 0 (0)

Focus:
	-A paradigm: Reality is a series of nested information systems. As above, so below. As in the
	 Digital Web, so in whatever meatspace runs on. (What M20 Core apparently labels "Everything is
	 Data".)
	-A practice: Hypertech
	-Instruments:
		-Computers (of course!)
			-Including a wearable rig comprised of a Google Glass-esque HUD with integrated sensors
			 and several control peripherals that you wear when out and about. 
		-A heavily customized cellphone, usually connected to the rest of the wearable rig or
		 whatever other computer you're using.
			-This is your personal instrument for your Correspondence affinity.
			-For a lot of your childhood, this phone (or at least what it descended from, several
			 iterations of customization earlier) _was_ your connection to a wider, digital world.
		-Your heavily customized suite of software packages.
		-A database of techniques and exploits. You've got a copy stored locally on your phone, and
		 backups in various spots around the web.
		-EEG sensor net and hardware, connecting to either the wearable rig or other computers.
			-Pulling your shaggy hair through the sensor net mostly conceals it.
			-A kind of read-only Brain/Computer Interface, but the rig reacting as fast as you think
			 still goes a long ways.
		-Controller Glove. Think the NES Power Glove.
		-Sensor and optics packages.
			-You keep a selection of these customized devices on hand, including several on your
			 person when out and one version connected to your pistol.

Merits & Flaws: (+7 Freebie Points)
	Addiction (3 pt. Physical Flaw, Core pg. 646):
		-You're addicted to stimulents.
	Computer Aptitude (1 pt. Mental Merit, BoS pg. 43): 
		-Minus 2 difficulty to "computer-based rolls", with some caveats about _limited_
		 applicability to magick that you didn't entirely follow.
	Driving Goal (3 pt. Mental Flaw, BoS pg. 51):
		-Taking down the corps would fit this exactly.
	Enemy (1 pt. Social Flaw, Core pg. 647):
		-You have an internet-troll-y rival. Quick to respond to your every post, nothing you do is
		 ever good or pure enough in their eyes, and they're quick to highlight your every mistake.
		-TODO: Flesh this enemy out a bit further, unless Lesley wants you to leave that to him.
	Overconfident (1 pt. Mental Flaw, BoS pg. 48):
		-I mean, you pretty much have to be, to take on the corps.

Rotes:
	1-800-QUINTESSENCE (Corr. 2, Prime 2) [Online, but modified & approved]:
		-This rote was invented by Virtual Adepts having problems getting quintessence when they were far from their nodes. However, by using the ordinary phone network or Internet to call a computer or phone near their home node, the Adepts can connect to it and absorb needed quintessence. This rote has been expanded to higher levels, using the networks as conduits for quintessence to their uses.
		-Lesley said this should require Prime 2.
	Arc (Correspondence 2, Forces 2) [Roll20 Digital Web Rotes Handout]:
		-One of the most basic Cyberpunk rotes, Arc allows an Adept to pull an electrical discharge from any nearby power source. This lightning bolt then arcs around the room hitting everything within a broad category set by the caster (for example, all machines in the room, all people, all plants, etc.)
		-System: The Adept uses Correspondence to target, and then unleashes an attack with Forces. She has a chance to hit every target within visual range, up to an amount equal to her Wits + Shoot rating, even if one or more targets are hidden or behind cover. Damage is based on the power source the Adept is drawing from, inflicting harm as per the electrocution rules (pg. 248 of the Mage rulebook.) The damage only lasts a single turn, and will not affect grounded targets
	Noise Cancellation (Forces 2) [Custom, approved]:
		-Using an available speaker-and-microphone equipped computer (like your wearable rig),
		 cancel out sound in an area by emitting a sound wave of the same amplitude but with
		 inverted phase.
		-Perhaps successes control area affected, or maybe the penalty on detecting sound affected
		 by the rote?
		-As an upgrade, any Virtual Adept worth their silicon can add Correspondence 2 to affect a
		 remote area.
			-TODO: Should that actually be Correspondence 3, since it's an effect, not a
			 sense, being done remotely?
				-Well, 2 _does_ allow the "Reach Through Space" effect, and allow the Arc
				 rote from Roll20, so sounds like 2 should suffice.
			-Talk to Lesley, and get this variant approved.
	Remote Access (Correspondence 2, Forces 2) [Roll20 Digital Web Rotes Handout]:
		-A simple but useful procedure, Access allows a spinner to tap into a network from some distance away. Sending a scanning wave through conduits until it reaches the proper place, the magus keys into the conduit and follows it either to its source in the Web, or to a computer that's hooked up to the area's reflection. Once he reaches that link, the Webspinner can see into that area (or through an active computer monitor), and possibly send a new rote through space and run it from a distance.
		-Correspondence sets up the link as per the usual Correspondence Ranges chart; Forces allows the mage to send or receive images between the remote location and his rig. Restricted Sectors or Constraint Realms are more difficult to access than normal sectors (six successes or so, as opposed to two or three). Viewing a distant place from a monitor or video camera does not grant the seer omniscient vision â€” anything that's too dark, indistinct or out of range to see clearly from the screen or lens cannot be seen with this rote.
	Search Engine (Correspondence 2, Entropy 1, Prime 1) [Roll20 Digital Web Rotes Handout]:
		-Also known as "Telephone," use this rote when you are looking for a Hacker or a Kibo to fit your needs. It either puts you in touch with someone who matches your request or someone who knows them. It should be noted that you can't find a specific person with this rote (though more advanced versions do exist to perform that function,) just people who fit a general need.
		-Correspondence is used to cast a wide net to search for your target. Prime is used to locate the target via his or her Essence (see the section on Names, pp. 43-44, for more information on why this is important.) Entropy makes sure that this person fits your needs. Each success gives you a 20% chance of locating the target or someone connected to that person. Be careful with this rote! There have been rare occasions when the best teacher for the situation turned out to be a member of the Technocracy - much to the Adept's (and the Technocrat's) surprise.
	TechnoVision (Correspondence 1, Entropy 1, Forces 1, Mind 1, Prime 1) [Roll20 Digital Web Rotes Handout]:
		-By shifting into readout mode, a Technocratic spinner can bring up a window, project an analysis field, and scan her surroundings. In the window, readouts track the area nearby, its inhabitants, their true natures, and their weaknesses.
		-Sensors invoke Rank One perceptions for the five Spheres mentioned. A Perception + Awareness roll, difficulty 4, usually tells the spinner what she needs to know about surface impressions. Hidden data, such as concealed ID codes or Arcane-cloaked icons, may raise the difficulty accordingly, or subtract from the searcher's Dice Pool.
		-Variant: Remote Sensing (Correspondence 2, Entropy 1, Forces 1, Mind 1, Prime 1):
			-As above, but for a remote location, employing accessible sensing devices (phones!) to
			 build a similar picture of that location for you.
	Traffic Pulse (Entropy 2, Forces 2) [Roll20 Digital Web Rotes Handout]:
		-For those who choose to listen to the music of the city, there is an underlying pattern, a rhythm, if you will, to all the rumbling and revving of the engines. With mastery of the Traffic Pulse, a mage can effect the time it takes traffic lights to turn, cause traffic to be heavy or sparse, even direct and prevent minor accidents. For a mage who literally lives on the streets, Traffic Pulse can be a useful magical tool.
	We'll Get There (Correspondence 1, Entropy 2) [Roll20 Digital Web Rotes Handout]:
		-This trick is a way to keep from getting lost in the surreal urban landscape that is a Cyberpunk's habitat. Combining a keen sense of direction with a good set of odds, the mage can usually stumble to where she wants to be or needs to be.
		-As long as the mage has a good idea of where she's going ("I need to get to Tadd's apartment...") a single success is enough to point her in the right direction and keep her on track. More successes clue the mage into short cuts that get her there faster. This rote is coincidental magic; the name of the rote itself is a good enough way to subtly pass off this effect.
	Where Am I? (Corr. 1) [Online, approved]:
		-The mage will know his position relative another, known place (like his home or his starting point). When the mage moves away from this place he will still know where it is and feel direction and distance to it.
	
	Rote ideas:
		-Some kind of Mind Shield effect with Mind 1?
			-Sounds like it typically means a boost to Willpower rolls to resist stuff, according
			 to Lesley: https://discord.com/channels/1029445785118576672/1029445785563172895/1032749354974462072
			-Maybe mixing Entropy in there, for something involving probability?
				-You have Entropy 2, which allows _controlling_ probability.
				-Potential flavor:
					-"A novel application of Bayesian spam-filtering algorithms. . ."
					-". . . crowd-sourced database of recorded mental intrusion attempts. . ."
		-What's required to "absorb Quintessence beyond their Avatar Background", as Prime 1
		 describes? A rote? Or is it automatic somehow?
			-Ah, the description of that in the Prime 1 text was confusing and specified "at least"
			 one dot in Prime to do this.
			-According to Lesley, it's Prime 2 to manipulate Quintessence, and 3 to transfer it to
			 someone else: https://discord.com/channels/1029445785118576672/1029445785563172895/1032749535652491364
		-More Entropy rotes!
			-Find flaws in software?
			-Some Ring of Truth effect?
			-Odds calculation?
			-Targeting software?
				-Ah, probably needs Life or Matter 1.
			-Decryption?
		-Lesley mentioned a hacking enhancing rote via voice?
		-Oh! What about the extra levels available for some Spheres while in the Digital Web?
			-"Characters with Correspondence, Forces or Prime can use those Spheres at one level
			  higher than their normal rating, up to a maximum of 5."
			-With that in mind, reskim the Roll20 rotes.
