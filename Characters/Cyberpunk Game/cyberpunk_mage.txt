Merits & Flaws: ( Freebie Points)
	Addiction (1 or 3 pt. Physical Flaw, Core pg. 646): ?
		-Caffeine or video games would both fit very well, and be 1 pt. A 3 pt. addiction to
		 stimulants would also fit pretty well.
	Blacklisted (1 to 5 pt. Flaw, BoS pg. 51): ?
		-2 pt. version give the "misdeanor criminal record" example, which might fit past drug
		 charges or similar.
	Computer Aptitude (1 pt. Merit, BoS pg. 43): 
		-Minus 2 difficulty to "computer-based rolls", with some caveats about _limited_
		 applicability to magick that you didn't totally follow.
	Concentration (1 pt. Merit, BoS pg. 43): ?
		-Eliminates modifiers from distractions, maybe with a Willpower roll for _really_ bad ones
		 like "trying to hack a computer system during a tornado".
	Curiosity (2 pt. Flaw, BoS pg. 48): ?
		-Wits roll between difficulty 5 and 9 to avoid following up on mysteries, depending on how
		 "compelling" they are.
	Driving Goal (3 pt. Flaw, BoS pg. 51): ?
		-Taking down the corps would fit this exactly.
	Hyperfocus (3 pt. Merit, BoS pg. 45): ?
		-Extra die for every hour spent focusing _without distractions_ on an extended
		 _not-magick-casting_ roll, up to 3.
	Echoes (1 to 5 pt. Supernatural Flaw, Core pg. 646): ?
		-A 1 pt. smell of ozone or similar following you around would be interesting, evoking
		 electrical problems and also causing the occasional accusation of smoking drugs.
	Enemy (1 to 5 pt. Social Flaw, Core pg. 647): ?
		-Low pt. version representing some internet-troll-y rival?
	Overconfident (1 pt. Flaw, BoS pg. 48): ?
		-I mean, you pretty much have to be, to take on the corps.
	Poison Resistance (2 pt. Merit, BoS pg. 37): ?
		-Flavorful for a slum childhood, and if you go down the route of drug abuse.
	PTSD (2 to 5 pt. Social Flaw, Core pg. 647): ?
		-If you go with a childhood defined by poverty, perhaps the 3 pt. version tied to financial
		 difficulties (an example given in teh book)?
	Monstrous (3 pt. Physical Flaw, BoS pg. 41): ?
		-Lesley mentioned the impovrished selling themselves as test subjects. This could be used
		 to reflect it, or perhaps Impediment?
