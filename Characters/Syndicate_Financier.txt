Merits & Flaws: ( Freebie Points)
	Computer Aptitude (1 pt. Mental Merit, BoS pg. 43): ??
		-All computer-based rolls get -2 difficulty, including magick (but only up to the magick-
		 roll limit of -3).
	Confidence (2 pt. Social Merit, BoS pg. 55): ?
		-Social rolls to impress others with your capabilities are -2 difficulty, while rolls for
		 others to shake your confidence or shatter your calm get +2 difficulty.
	Dogmatic (2 pt. Social Flaw, BoS pg. 64):
		-You really believe in the system, which, for you, is capital-T-Technocratic capitalism and
		 you're here to preach it. After all, it elevated you, as you clearly deserved, so it knows
		 what it's doing.
		-You get +2 difficulty to all social rolls when dealing with people who disagree.
	Enchanting Feature (Enchanting Voice, 2 pt. Physical Merit, BoS pg. 37): ?
		-Applies -2 difficulty to related rolls, including casting difficulty if used as a Focus,
		 where it counts as a personalized unique instrument.
		-Picked the Enchanting Voice wording from the form of the merit in V20, where it gives "-2
		 difficulty for "all die rolls involving the use of the voice to persuade, charm or
		 command". Probably a good fit for this character, but there could be other options. BoS
		 lists a "Soothing Voice" option.
	Enemy (3 pt. Social Flaw, Core pg. 647):
		-Right in the middle of the 1 to 5 pt. range, which ranges from a minor grudge from the
		 inconsequential to the deadly plans of some powerful entity or group.
		-I'm imagining a vampire, probably a Ventrue, that your business dealings (and all too
		 similar parasitism of the productive economy) crossed the path of, offending the
		 territorial creature.
	Impediment (Bad Sight, 1 pt. Physical Flaw, BoS pg. 39):
		-+2 difficulty for rolls involving eyesight. Can wear glasses for it, or it would be more
		 points.
		-(Based the details on the Bad Sight V20 flaw, but BoS also lists something similar in it's
		  description of a 1 pt. Impediment.)
	Overconfident (1 pt. Mental Flaw, BoS pg. 48):
		-You wildly over estimate yourself. Even though you are really great, of course.
	Poker Face (2 pt. Physical Merit, BoS pg. 38): ??
		-
